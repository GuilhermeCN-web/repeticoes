## 📝 1. Auto-assignment and Operators

Auto-assignment operators allow us to **update a variable's value** within a loop.

### 🔹 Basic Auto-assignment
```python
x = 5
x += 1  # Equivalent to x = x + 1
print(x)  # Output: 6
Operator	Example	Meaning
+=	x += 1	Adds and assigns
-=	x -= 1	Subtracts and assigns
*=	x *= 2	Multiplies and assigns
/=	x /= 2	Divides and assigns
